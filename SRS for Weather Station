Software Requirement Specification for Wlderness Weather Station:

Preface:
This document serves as a software requirement specification for Wilderness Weather Station. The version number of this document is 1.
This document may be subject to change if the requirements of the project is altered or updated. This document is intended for software
developers and customer/user.

Introduction:
The Wilderness Weather Station is intended to serve as a weather forecasting system that includes reading data regarding changes in
weather and generating report based on the data. The Wilderness Weather Station has three seperate systems that work together. The Weather 
Station System collects weather related data. The Data Management and Archive System analyzes and archives the data. The Station Maintenance
System checks the health of the systems and generate report based on system issues.

User Requirements Definition:
     Functional Requirements:
     The Wilderness Weather Station consists of three separate systems that work collectively to serve as a Weather Forecasting System.
     The three systems are:
     1. The Weather Station System: This is responsible for collecting weather data, carrying out some initial data processing, and 
     transmitting  it to the data management system. The Weather Stations are battery powered and has no external cables attached to them.
     2. The Data Management and Archiving System: This system collects the data from all of the wilderness weather stations, carries out 
     data processing and analysis, and archives the data in a form that can be retrieved by other systems, such as weather forecasting
     systems.
     3. The Station Maintenance System: This system can communicate by satellite with all wilderness weather stations to monitor the health  
     of these systems and provide reports of problems. It can update the embedded software in these systems. In the event of system problems, 
     this system can also be used to remotely control a wilderness weather system.
   
     Non-functional Requirements:
     Data needs to be collected at frequent intervals. Software's user-interface needs to be fairly simple. Software needs to be developed 
     in a way so that it can be easily updated or expanded.
     
     Constraints:
     The Weather Stations will be deployed in rural areas where they will be exposed to harsh weather conditions. The Weather Station will
     not have any expernal wiring. They will only communiate via satellite with a narrow bandwidth.
